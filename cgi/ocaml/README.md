pin4sha is an API wrapper for https://github.com/sebsauvage/Shaarli (and compatible
/ identical HTTP form fields) exposing the https://pinboard.in/api.

It's a

* zero-config,
* drop-in,
* single-file

cgi deployment. Download or compile the appropriate binary for your server, drop it
right into the shaarli filesystem directory and start using the pinboard API at the
endpoint
